## The idea behind the example (per the Supabase documentation)

> This example provides the steps to build a basic user management app. It includes:
>
>- Supabase Database: a Postgres database for storing your user data.
>- Supabase Auth: users can sign in with magic links (no passwords, only email)
>- Supabase Storage: users can upload a photo.
>- Row Level Security: data is protected so that individuals can only access their own data.
>- Instant APIs: APIs will be automatically generated when you create your database tables.
>
> By the end of this guide you'll have an app which allows users to login and update some basic profile details."
